# Photo Gallery

This is project that I created to demonstrate my skills using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I felt that doing a photo gallery of some of my favorite trips would be a nice way to try and come back to doing full on front-end web design, and I can say that it has. This project gave me a good refresher on some of the things that I've incorporated into school assignments or projects as well as learning new elements that have helped me with developing the overall appearance and functionality of what I wanted to achieve making this.

This project is developed and designed for both desktop and mobile view, and will be updated in the future with more galleries and possibly with updated designs and features.

Feel free to view my code in this repository. Sources I used to help me along the way are in both my CSS files, and in my JavaScript file. I've also provided comments within parts of my code to explain the purpose of what the code does.

Thank you for checking out my work!
