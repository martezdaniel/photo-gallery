# Photo Gallery

This is project that I created to demonstrate my skills with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I felt that doing a photo gallery of some of my favorite trips would be a nice way to try and come back to doing full on front-end web design, and I can say that it has. This project gave me a good refresher on some of the things that I've incorporated into school assignments or projects as well as learning new elements that have helped me with developing the overall appearance and functionality of what I wanted to achieve making this.
